Date,Note
"","On August 1, 2019, the data for 2018 for “Total impaired driving” have been corrected."



Footnotes:
1,"Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents."
2,"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services. For more information on the concepts, methods and quality of the data contained in this table, please contact the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics at statcan.ccjcss-ccsjsc.statcan@statcan.gc.ca."
3,"The methodology for calculating census metropolitan area (CMA) populations was modified in 2003. Starting in 1996, the populations for CMAs have been adjusted to reflect the actual policing boundaries within the CMA and do not reflect the official Statistics Canada population for these CMAs. CMA data are included within province-level data."
4,"Police reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with minor offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might chose to deal with some minor offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Counts are based on the most serious violation in the incident."
5,"In January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes that consider the complexities of certain offences such as sexual assault, family violence and intimate partner violence. Under the new reporting standards, specific offences may be more likely reported by police as founded rather than unfounded (or unsubstantiated), which would exclude them from police-reported crime rates and crime severity indices. Data for 2019 represent the first complete year of UCR data collected under the new reporting standards.  As a result, for selected violations and police services, the actual proportion of incidents in 2019 that were classified as “not cleared” has increased. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years."
6,"A high crime rate or Crime Severity Index (CSI) may indicate that a municipality is a geographical area that provides commercial business, human or public services, or entertainment for many people who reside outside, as well as inside, the municipality. As a result, these municipalities may have large part-time or temporary populations which are excluded from both their population bases and their crime rate and CSI calculations."
7,"Under the authority of the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal (CFPM), the Canadian Forces Military Police Group (CF MP Gp) is now reporting incidents to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey. They have provided incidents going back to January 2020. Data from the Office of the CFPM are aggregated at the national level to account for small counts and to protect confidentiality. Therefore, provincial and territorial totals will not equal Canada-level totals. Currently, the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics (CCJCSS) is developing the methodology for determining the population counts for the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). Therefore Crime Severity Index data and rates are not available."
8,"It is important to note that while official police-reported data on crime from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey use Statistics Canada's standard Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) names, the boundaries for the policing-based CMAs do not always fully align with the standard CMA geographic units used for disseminating information about the Census of Population."
9,"With the release of 2012 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2004. This resulted in boundary changes for the census metropolitan areas (CMA) of Saint John for 2005 to 2011 and for Winnipeg for 2011. Crime data for these years for these respondents have therefore been revised."
10,"Under the authority of the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal (CFPM), the Canadian Forces Military Police Group (CF MP Gp) is now reporting incidents to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey. They have provided incidents going back to January 2020. Therefore, comparisons with data previous to 2020 should be made with caution."
11,"Homicide data are extracted from the Homicide Survey database. For further information, refer to: <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3315-eng.htm" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Homicide Survey (opens new window)</a>."
12,"In general, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) counts any adult and youth charged for the year in which the charge was laid. The homicide totals, which come from The Homicide Survey, count any adult or youth charged with a homicide that occurred in the reference year, regardless of when the charge was laid."
13,"Robbery counts have been revised for the years 1998 to 2007. This change has resulted in an increase of approximately 12% annually in the number of reported robbery incidents for this time period. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years."
14,"Detailed information of this category is available upon request."
15,"The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Ottawa-Gatineau was formerly known as Ottawa-Hull."
16,"Ottawa numbers also include child pornography incidents reported by the National Child Exploitation Crime Centre of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) which is located in the City of Ottawa. The Centre responds to internet-facilitated sexual abuse cases nationally. Therefore, while the incidents are detected by the RCMP Centre located in Ottawa and appear in Ottawa's crime statistics, the incidents themselves or the offenders are not limited to the city of Ottawa."
17,"Prior to 2013, all incidents of child pornography recorded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Service's Canadian Police Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (CPCMEC), located in Ottawa, were reported under the Ottawa Police Service. In 2014, Statistics Canada began reporting CPCMEC data separately and revised data for 2013 to account for this change. As a result of revisions to the 2013 data, some incidents identified by the CPCMEC and referred to the Ottawa Police Service for investigation may have been transferred to the CPCMEC. As such, the revised number of incidents for Ottawa Police Service for 2013 may be underrepresented and should not be compared to other years."
18,"Abbotsford-Mission, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario became new census metropolitan areas (CMAs) as of the 2001 Census. Moncton, New Brunswick, Peterborough, Ontario, Brantford, Ontario, Guelph, Ontario, Barrie, Ontario, and Kelowna, British Columbia became new CMAs as of the 2006 Census. Lethbridge, Alberta and Belleville, Ontario became new CMAs as of the 2016 Census. Fredericton, New Brunswick; Drummondville, Quebec; Red Deer, Alberta; Kamloops, British Columbia; Chilliwack, British Columbia and Nanaimo, British Columbia became new CMAs as of the 2021 Census."
19,"The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Belleville-Quinte West was formerly known as Belleville."
20,"In 2009, slight changes were made to the respondent-to-CMA mapping for this census metropolitan area (CMA) which have resulted in minor revisions to previously published data."
21,"In 2018, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) reporting practices for drug seizures reported by Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) to the RCMP in Niagara were amended to better align with the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) survey in an effort to report consistent and accurate data. Due to this amendment in reporting practices, the RCMP detachment provided an estimate of the actual number of incidents for violations in 2017. Data should therefore be used with caution."
22,"With the Government of Canada's March 2020 announcement of restrictions on persons arriving in or departing from Canada, pursuant to its powers under the Quarantine Act, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey was adjusted to add a specific Quarantine Act violation code (6600). As police services adopt this new code and adjust to the new reporting requirements, there may be data revisions made to correct any misreporting of these incidents."
23,"Previous to 2014, Greater Sudbury (35290) would record only those incidents where a search warrant was obtained and a charge related to child pornography was laid. As of 2014, reporting practices have changed to include all information of IP addresses with links to child pornography for information gathering and intelligence purposes. Therefore, comparisons with previous years should be made with caution."
